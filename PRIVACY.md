# Privacy

MacAIterm runs on your Mac. There is **no account, no telemetry, no analytics and no crash reporting**. This page lists exactly what is stored, what can leave the machine, and when.

## What is stored (all local, in `~/Library/Application Support/MacAIterm/`)

| File / folder | Content | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `settings.json` | your settings | no secrets |
| `secrets.json` | API keys you saved in Settings | encrypted with the macOS Keychain (Electron `safeStorage`); if encryption is unavailable the key is **not** saved |
| `history/*.jsonl` | session history: requests, AI messages, commands, outputs | secrets are masked before writing; can be switched off (Settings → "세션 기록 저장") and deleted per session; the newest 200 are kept |
| `audit/*.jsonl` | every command the AI ran or tried to run + approve/deny decisions | secrets masked; exportable (Settings) |
| `usage/*.jsonl` | **token counts only** per API call (provider, host, model, input/output/cached tokens) | never prompts, answers or keys |
| `project-rules.json` | "always allow" rules you chose to keep per project | stored here, never inside a repository |
| `tabs.json`, `llm-settings.json`, `kv-engine.json`, `theme` | open tabs / chosen model / the private engine's process id / light-dark | |
| `ssh-sessions.json` | the SSH sessions you saved in the side bar: name, folder, host, port, user name, the **path** of a key file, jump host, tunnels, X11 mode | **never a password, passphrase or key**; the file is private (mode 0600); every field is validated before it can reach a command line |
| `ssh-recent.json` | destinations (`user@host[:port]` or an `~/.ssh/config` name) of the last SSH sessions | names only; mode 0600 |

Delete everything: quit the app and remove that folder. Nothing is stored anywhere else (your shell history stays in your own `~/.zsh_history`).

## Data that can leave your Mac

| Feature | What is sent | To whom | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Local model (default)** | prompts and command output | `127.0.0.1` (your own Ollama) | every request; never leaves the machine |
| **OpenAI-compatible server** (LM Studio, gateway, OpenAI API) | the conversation context and your API key | the server you entered in Settings | only after you pick it in the model chip; remote servers are never selected automatically and the UI warns that the context is sent off-device |
| **Codex CLI** | the conversation context | OpenAI via the `codex` tool | only after you pick it; its login is handled by `codex`, not by this app |
| **Official usage lookup** | your *admin* key and a date range | `api.openai.com` (organization Usage / Costs endpoints) | only when you press "공식 사용량 불러오기" |
| **Update check** | nothing but the request itself | `api.github.com` (releases of this repository) | off by default; when you press "지금 확인" or turn it on |
| **Model download** | the model name | your Ollama → its registry | only when you press a download button; the app never downloads on its own |
| **Opening links** | n/a | `ollama.com`, `github.com`, `platform.openai.com` pages | only on click (other addresses are refused) |

## SSH (servers you connect to)

- The app **never asks for, receives or stores an SSH password or key passphrase**. You type it in the terminal, exactly as with plain `ssh`. Saved sessions hold *where* to connect, never *how to authenticate* beyond the path of a key file you chose (the key itself is never read by the app).
- The server monitor and the file panel use a **separate, non-interactive** `ssh` connection (`BatchMode=yes`: it can never prompt, so it works with key login or with the shared connection of a session you opened from the side bar). When no such connection is possible they simply stay empty.
- The monitor runs one **read-only** script (it reads `/proc`, `vm_stat`, `df`, `nvidia-smi` …) and parses the numbers; nothing is written on the server. The file panel only does what you click or drag.
- With the AI on a server, commands and file tools run on that server **through the terminal you can see** (or through the same connection, after it proved to reach the same account). Their output goes to your configured model like any other command output: with a cloud model that means server output leaves your Mac, just as it would for local commands; secrets are masked first. Changes on a server always ask for approval (Settings → SSH).
- Host-key warnings (changed key, refused connection …) are shown as notes in the timeline with the key fingerprint; the app never answers a host-key question for you.
- Everything the app writes during a transfer is verified with SHA-256 before it replaces anything; a cancelled transfer never leaves a half-written file under its final name. Files you drag out to the Finder are cached in a temporary folder that is removed when the app quits.

## API keys

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` are read from the environment (including from your login shell, because an app started from the Dock does not inherit `~/.zshrc`) and are held in the app's memory only.
- The environment `OPENAI_API_KEY` is sent to `api.openai.com` **only**; for any other server only a key you saved for it in Settings is used.
- Keys are never shown in the UI (it only shows the *source*: environment / Keychain), never logged, and masked if they ever appear in command output, history, audit or the text sent to the model.
- This app never enters credentials on your behalf and the AI cannot read key files (`~/.ssh`, `.env`, cloud credentials … are blocked and masked).

## What the AI can see

The AI sees the terminal state it needs for the request: the working directory listing, project files it opens, recent command output. **Outputs and file contents are treated as untrusted data** (a file cannot give the AI instructions), secrets are masked before anything is sent to a model, and risky actions need your approval (see "동작 원칙" in the README). With a local model none of this leaves the Mac.

## Contact form on the website

If you use the contact form on the MacAIterm website, the name, email address, topic and message you type are sent to the site's server, which forwards them to the maintainer by email. The site does not keep a copy of the message. To limit spam, the server briefly keeps a salted hash of your IP address together with the time of the request (at most one hour). The form is optional: you can use GitHub issues instead.

## Changes to this page

If this behaviour ever changes it will be recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` before release.
